● SQL being the most influential commercially marketed relational query SQL
language has several parts:

  ○ Data Definition Language (DDL), which provides commands for defining relation
    schemas, deleting relations, and modifying relation schemas
  ○ Data Manipulation Language (DML), which includes a query language and
    command to insert tuples into, delete tuples from, and modify tuples within the database.

● The SQL DDL is used to create relations with specified schemas. In addition to
specifying the names and types of relation attributes, SQL also allows the specification of
integrity constraints such as primary key constraints and foreign key constraints.

● SQL provides constructs for updating, inserting, and deleting information.

● SQL includes a variety of languages constructs for queries on the database. These
include the SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses.

● SQL supports basic set operations on relations, including the UNION, INTERSECT, and
EXCEPT operations.

● SQL supports aggregation, including the ability to divide a relation into groups, applying
aggregation separately on each group. SQL also supports set operations on groups.

● SQL supports nested subqueries in the WHERE and FROM clauses of an outer query. It
also supports scalar subqueries wherever an expression returning a value is permitted.
